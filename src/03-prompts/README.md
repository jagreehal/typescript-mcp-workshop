# MCP Demo: Prompts

This demo explores the role and structure of "prompts" in the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Overview

In the context of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), a prompt is the input given to the model to elicit a response. Within MCP, while tools and resources provide structured actions and data, the prompt is often the primary way a user communicates their intent or question to the AI assistant.

Effective prompting is crucial for getting desired outputs from an LLM. This demo illustrates:

- How prompts are typically formatted and sent.
- The kind of information that can be included in a prompt (user query, system messages, few-shot examples, etc.).
- How the AI assistant interprets and responds to these prompts.

## How it Works

1.  **User Input/System Design:** The user provides a query, or the system constructs a prompt based on user input and other contextual information (like available tools, resources, or pre-defined instructions).
2.  **Prompt Formulation:** The input is formatted into a structured prompt. This might involve:
    - **System Message:** Instructions to the AI about its role, personality, or constraints.
    - **User Message:** The actual query or instruction from the user.
    - **Assistant Messages (Few-shot):** Examples of desired interactions to guide the AI.
    - **Tool/Resource Information:** Descriptions or availability of tools and resources might be implicitly or explicitly part of the context the prompt operates within.
3.  **Sending to AI:** The complete prompt is sent to the LLM via the MCP framework.
4.  **AI Processing:** The LLM processes the prompt.
5.  **Response Generation:** The AI generates a response. This could be a text answer, a decision to call a tool, or a combination.

## Running the Demo

_(TODO: Add specific commands to run this demo. This might involve a CLI command or steps to trigger the interaction, e.g., `npm run demo:prompts` or similar. Refer to `package.json` or project scripts.)_

When running this demo, pay attention to the structure of the input provided to the AI and how variations in the prompt can lead to different responses or actions from the assistant.

## Key MCP Features/Concepts Demonstrated

- **User Intent Capture:** How prompts serve as the primary vehicle for user intent.
- **Prompt Engineering Basics:** The idea that the structure and content of a prompt significantly affect AI output.
- **Integration with Tools/Resources:** While not the focus, prompts operate in an environment where tools and resources (defined by MCP) exist and can be referenced or triggered based on the prompt.

## Best Practices for Prompting

- **Clarity and Specificity:** Be as clear and specific as possible in your instructions or questions.
- **Context:** Provide sufficient context if the query depends on it.
- **Role Definition (System Prompt):** If you want the AI to adopt a particular persona or follow specific rules, state this clearly (often in a system message).
- **Examples (Few-shot):** For complex tasks, providing a few examples of good inputs and outputs can greatly improve results.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Prompting is often an iterative process. Experiment and refine your prompts to get the best outcomes.

This demo highlights the importance of the prompt as the conversational interface to the AI, working in conjunction with the more structured elements of tools and resources within the MCP framework.
