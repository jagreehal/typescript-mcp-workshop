# MCP Demo: Resources

This demo illustrates the concept of "resources" within the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Overview

In MCP, resources represent contextual information or data that can be made available to an AI assistant. Unlike tools, which are invokable actions, resources are typically read-only pieces of information that the assistant can use to inform its responses or decision-making processes.

Examples of resources include:

- **User Profile:** Information about the current user.
- **Application State:** Current settings or data within the application.
- **Knowledge Bases:** Snippets from FAQs, documentation, or other relevant texts.
- **Real-time Data:** Stock prices, weather information, etc.

This demo focuses on how resources are defined, provided, and potentially utilized by an assistant within an MCP interaction.

## How it Works

1.  **Resource Definition:** Resources are defined with a name and a schema (often implicitly or explicitly a string or simple JSON structure).
2.  **Resource Provisioning:** The MCP application makes the resource available. This could involve fetching data from a database, an API, or simply providing static content.
3.  **Assistant Access (Implicit or Explicit):**
    - **Implicit:** The resource content might be automatically injected into the prompt or context provided to the AI assistant.
    - **Explicit:** The assistant might be aware of available resources and specifically request or refer to them (though this blurs slightly into tool-like behavior if it's an active fetch).
4.  **Contextual Enhancement:** The assistant uses the information from the resource to generate a more informed, relevant, or personalized response.

## Running the Demo

_(TODO: Add specific commands to run this demo. This might involve a CLI command or steps to trigger the interaction, e.g., `npm run demo:resources` or similar. Refer to `package.json` or project scripts.)_

When you run this demo, observe how a piece of contextual information (the resource) is made available and how it influences the assistant's behavior or output, even if the assistant doesn't explicitly call a "tool" to get it.

## Key MCP Features Demonstrated

- **Resource Concept:** Understanding what constitutes a resource in MCP.
- **Making Resources Available:** How applications can provide contextual data.
- **Contextual Influence:** How resources can shape an AI's responses without direct tool invocation for that specific piece of data.

## Best Practices

- **Relevance:** Provide resources that are directly relevant to the types of tasks the assistant is expected to perform.
- **Conciseness:** Keep resource content as concise as possible to avoid overwhelming the assistant or consuming excessive context window.
- **Freshness:** Ensure that resources providing dynamic data are kept up-to-date.
- **Clarity:** If the assistant is expected to be aware of resources, their naming and purpose should be clear.

This demo helps in understanding how MCP allows for rich contextual information to be seamlessly integrated into AI interactions, leading to more capable and knowledgeable assistants.
